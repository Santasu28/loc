## Overview

Atlas-Loc provides a challenging low-altitude UAV localization benchmark for
studying robust visual relocalization under severe appearance changes and GNSS
degradation.

## Dataset

The **FHY_dataset** is collected across representative urban and suburban
environments at **120-150 m** flight altitude, matching practical low-altitude
logistics and eVTOL route settings. Instead of flying arbitrarily over dense
building blocks, the trajectories follow roads, roadside green belts, and nearby
open areas, reflecting realistic airspace, safety-distance, and privacy
constraints.

</p>

The dataset covers three typical low-altitude scenes: mixed high-rise and
low-rise urban areas, dense skyscraper regions with city-canyon effects, and
texture-sparse suburban roads with grassland and vegetation. Each scene is
repeatedly captured across seasons, time periods, weather conditions, and
illumination changes, including sunny, cloudy, overcast low-light, foggy, rainy,
and night-time flights.

These sequences introduce strong visual challenges such as cross-season
vegetation changes, large building shadows, low contrast, rain blur and
reflections, dynamic vehicles, extreme fog-induced visibility loss, and
day-to-night relocalization under street lighting. The dataset can therefore
serve as a benchmark for evaluating visual SLAM, learning-based SLAM, dense
matching SLAM, and map-based relocalization methods in realistic low-altitude
urban environments.
